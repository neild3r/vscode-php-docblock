Basic PHP DocBlocking extension. This extension was hastily written to cover the temporary gap in a more comprehensive DocBlocking plugin that covers multiple languages.

We now have a set of unit tests and some decent coverage on the parsing of signitures as well as some continuous integration. This should ensure the extension remains stable as development progresses.

## Features

* Completion snippet after `/**` above a class, function, class property
* Continuation of DocBlock when pressing enter when in a DocBlock
* Completion of DocBlock tags such as `@param`, `@return`, `@throws`
* Inferring of param and return types from signitures

## Requirements

This extension has no dependencies.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `php-docblocker.gap`: set to `false` to disable the gap between the description and tags
* `php-docblocker.extra`: an array of extra tags to add to each DocBlock
